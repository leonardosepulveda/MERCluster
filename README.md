# MERCluster - analysis of groups of datasets

MERcluster leverages the [MERlin](https://github.com/ZhuangLab/MERlin) core
architecture, but focuses on analyses that are performed on the analysis results
output from MERlin. At present, the primary implemented tasks relate to clustering 
but the general architecture present here is easily extensible to additional tasks. 

The mercluster.core modules are reproduced from merlin.core with some
components removed for simplicity, and other added to aid analysis of groups
of datasets.
