# MERCluster - analysis of groups of datasets

MERcluster leverages the MERlin core architecture, but focuses on analyses that
are performed on the analysis results output from MERlin. At present, the 
primary implemented tasks relate to clustering but the general 
architecture present here is easily extensible to additional tasks. 

The mercluster.core modules are reproduced from merlin.core with some
components removed for simplicity, and other added to aid analysis of groups
of datasets.

MERCluster is under active development, pull requests welcome.
